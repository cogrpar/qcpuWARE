                The binary quadratic model.

                Must be at least the minimum required for the number of problem variables,
                which is calculated and set by default.
                The minimum time for a hybrid solver is specified as a piecewise-linear
                curve defined by a set of floating-point pairs, the `minimum_time_limit`
                field under :attr:`.LeapHybridSampler.properties`. The first element in each
                pair is the number of problem variables; the second is the minimum
                required time. The minimum time for any particular number of variables
                is a linear interpolation calculated on two pairs that represent the
                relevant range for the given number of variables.
                For example, if `LeapHybridSampler().properties["minimum_time_limit"]`
                returns `[[1, 0.1], [100, 10.0], [1000, 20.0]]`, then the minimum time
                for a 50-variable problem is 5 seconds, the linear interpolation of the
                first two pairs that represent problems with between 1 to 100 variables.

            **kwargs:
                Optional keyword arguments for the solver, specified in
                :attr:`.LeapHybridSampler.parameters`.
